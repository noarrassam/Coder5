## JavaScript:

1. **Home-page**

- The main idea of the slide show is to use jQuery through setting an function, including to hover on the slideshow to make it pause while its moving from right to left.
- `ul` tag is used to gather all photos into one box, including the overflow: hidden tag was used to coombine all photos into one box.

```javaScript
    function beginSLide()
        interval = setInterval(function()
    function stopSlide()
        clearInterval(interval);
    $sContainer
        .on('mouseenter', stopSlide).on('mouseleave', beginSLide);
    beginSLide();

```
    

2. **Login Page**
- _JavaScript_ is used to validate the registration and login forms, including using push method to add an new users to an array using `for` loop.

3. **bio-page**
- _JavaScript_ is used to create a simple carousel slides to the left and right hand sides to preview my portfolio through using jQuery and special functions such as below:

```javaScript

$(document).ready(function(){
    $('.next').on('click', function(){
      var currentImg = $('.active');
      var nextImg = currentImg.next();
  
    $('.prev').on('click', function(){
      var currentImg = $('.active');
      var prevImg = currentImg.prev();
```
4. **welcome**
- This page contains a body that created for people who successfuly registered and logged in into the login page.
- It contains a `function` for the sign out button used by _JavaScript_ to directly to visit to the home-page after pressing the `signing out` buttom.
